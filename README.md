If you clone it and create a catkin_ws try:

#### Run a rviz to see that the urdf is correct and you can move the joint

```
$ roslaunch simple_robot_description rviz_simple.launch

```

#### Run a gazebo, and you will see that something is wrong

```
$ roslaunch simple_robot_gazebo simple_robot_gazebo.launch 

```

Some one you know what is wrong?
